The intuition is that temporal learning is hard through the zig-zag pattern, but spatial correlations may indeed be easier, allowing the network to dedication the feed forward path to spatiotemporal information, and the layer-to-layer paths stick to the temporal. The results outshine ConvLSTM in several baseline tasks for sequence to sequence prediction from snapshots.  }

Demonstration of the work on two problems is provided: inferring the density of 4 gas concentrations given satellite measurements and the inference of a transmissivity field for a groundwater well, both on the order of a few thousand parameters.}

The method divides the temporal domain into smaller, independent intervals, which are then solved in parallel. The intervals are then ``stitched'' together to get a field over the entire duration. Then advection of a tracer is computed within the composed field.}

  annote  = {Neural Processes (NPs) combine neural networks and GPs. The intent is to create a neural network that emulates a stochastic process: it will learn to model distributions over functions, estimate uncertainty over predictions conditioned on observations, and require fewer training resources. It is additionally linear in the number of observation and query points, rather than cubed (as in GPs). Necessary and sufficient conditions to define a stochastic process are exchangeability and consistency. In a neural process, we assume that a stoachastic process $F$ can be parameterised by a high-dimensional random vector $z$ such that $F(x) = g(x,z)$ where $g$ is fixed and learnable. Then the generative model is defined not unlike a variational autoencoder: $p(z)$ is a multivariate standard normal and the function $g$ is a NN which captures model complexities. To train, multiple datasets are required concurrently so to learn the variability of random functions. $g$ can be learned using amortized variational inference, in which the ELBO to optimize is with respect to the conditional distributions of context given targets. The NP ultimately consists of an encoder which takes input pairs and produces a representation. An aggregator summarises these encoded inputs; the mean function is used as it is order invariant. A conditional decoder then takes sampled global latent variables and new targets and outputs predictions for the targets.}

  annote={Creates a kernel which deals with the assumption of "stationarity" in GP kernel design. Unlike the nonstationary or nonseperable kernels seen before, this kernel class (attentive kernels) overcomes learning issues (other kernels are too flexible) by a learned ``selection'' process for correlation scales and relevant data subsampling. This selection process is done by learning weights to fixed lengthscale stationary kernels, extending inputs to higher dimensions, and creating a masking function for the input data in order to automatically partition related data areas. The weights and masks are functions which are described as simple neural networks. The method outperforms DKL, which uses input warping.}

    abstract = {This paper presents experimental results from a pulsed quantum cascade laser based cavity ringdown spectrometer used as a high-throughput detection system. The results were obtained from an optical cavity with 99.8\% input and output coupling mirrors that was rapidly swept (0.2s to 7s sweep times) between 1582.25 cm{\textminus}1 (6.3201$\mu$m) and 1697.00 cm{\textminus}1 (5.8928$\mu$m). The spectrometer was able to monitor gas species over the pressure range 585 torr to 1$\mu$torr, and the analysis involves a new digital data processing system that optimises the processing speed and minimises the data storage requirements. In this approach we show that is it not necessary to make direct measurements of the ringdown time of the cavity to obtain the system dynamics. Furthermore, we show that correct data processing is crucial for the ultimate implementation of a wideband IR spectrometer that covers a range similar to that of commercial Fourier transform infrared instruments.},

This is done by modifying the LSTM nodes to contain both layer-to-layer memory (like a typically ConvLSTM) and feed forward-state memory (which allows for a ``zig-zag'' passing of memory). The intuition is that temporal learning is hard through the zig-zag pattern, but spatial correlations may indeed be easier, allowing the network to dedication the feed forward path to spatiotemporal information, and the layer-to-layer paths stick to the temporal. The results outshine ConvLSTM in several baseline tasks for sequence to sequence prediction from snapshots.  }

By exploiting lower-dimensional structure, heuristics can be developed for model approxiation that lead to faster inference regimes. This paper presents certified error bounds on the use of these heuristic methods for non-linear-Gaussian systems. Demonstration of the work on two problems is provided: inferring the density of 4 gas concentrations given satellite measurements and the inference of a transmissivity field for a groundwater well, both on the order of a few thousand parameters.}

  annote  = {Neural Processes (NPs) combine neural networks and GPs. The intent is to create a neural network that emulates a stochastic process: it will learn to model distributions over functions, estimate uncertainty over predictions conditioned on observations, and require fewer training resources. It is additionally linear in the number of observation and query points, rather than cubed (as in GPs). Necessary and sufficient conditions to define a stochastic process are exchangeability and consistency. In a neural process, we assume that a stoachastic process $F$ can be parameterised by a high-dimensional random vector $z$ such that $F(x) = g(x,z)$ where $g$ is fixed and learnable. Then the generative model is defined not unlike a variational autoencoder: $p(z)$ is a multivariate standard normal and the function $g$ is a NN which captures model complexities. To train, multiple datasets are required concurrently so to learn the variability of random functions. $g$ can be learned using amortized variational inference, in which the ELBO to optimize is with respect to the conditional distributions of context given targets. The NP ultimately consists of an encoder which takes input pairs and produces a representation. An aggregator summarises these encoded inputs; the mean function is used as it is order invariant. A conditional decoder then takes sampled global latent variables and new targets and outputs predictions for the targets.}

  title={AK: Attentive Kernel for Information Gathering},
  author={Chen, Weizhe and Khardon, Roni and Liu, Lantao},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.06426},
  year={2022},
  annote={Creates a kernel which deals with the assumption of "stationarity" in GP kernel design. Unlike the nonstationary or nonseperable kernels seen before, this kernel class (attentive kernels) overcomes learning issues (other kernels are too flexible) by a learned ``selection'' process for correlation scales and relevant data subsampling. This selection process is done by learning weights to fixed lengthscale stationary kernels, extending inputs to higher dimensions, and creating a masking function for the input data in order to automatically partition related data areas. The weights and masks are functions which are described as simple neural networks. The method outperforms DKL, which uses input warping.}
