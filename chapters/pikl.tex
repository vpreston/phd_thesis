% Physically-Informed Kernel Learning
\begin{itemize}
    \item want to put the robot in the right place at the right time
    \item right place is a function of spatiotemporal structure OR you'd like to extract more information from your observation model (not smooth away the structure of the field data)
    \item capturing spatiotemporal structure is difficult with time-averaged models which smooth away any structure that might be relevant, but it is computationally intractable to compute this online for use on a robot
    \item pikl formulates a fast neural compensator for time-averaged models which yields finer-grain spatiotemporal structure and the statistics of that structure which can be used in solving inverse problems and forward simulating for decision-making
