% Environmental science was something introduced to me as a child with field trips to the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) on the Chesapeake Bay in central Maryland. 
% There, they would teach us about the role of marshes as a great ``buffer'' for pollution, take us out seining for animal biodiversity counts (and show us how to identify all the little critters that got caught up in the nets), and let us visit field stations where water quality was monitored.
% These field trips were part of a larger effort to engage children, their families, and their communities in feeling connected and responsible for the Bay's health.
