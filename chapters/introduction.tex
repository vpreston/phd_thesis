The environmental sciences are a multidisciplinary endeavor to understand the Earth, its ecosystems, and its processes, for which \emph{in situ} observational studies or \emph{expeditions} serve as the foundation on which scientific discovery and model development are predicated.
Robots are uniquely well-positioned to advance long-term monitoring of and exploration in meso-scale~\footnote{tens of meters to several kilometers} planetary environments through autonomous expeditions.
By virtue of their form, robots can be used in extreme places (e.g., deep sea), dangerous scenarios (e.g., edge of calving ice sheets), or long-term missions (e.g., Mars exploration). Increasingly, robotic platforms are being developed for scientific expeditions, but their autonomous capabilities are typically limited to executing predetermined hand-designed trajectories, e.g., uniform coverage lawnmowers~\autocite{camilli2010tracking}.
This restriction is often applied in order for trajectories to be rigorously checked by teams of science or engineering staff prior to execution as a policy of risk reduction, and for ease of supervision during execution.
Operating without agency (i.e., nonadaptively) necessarily restricts the class of phenomena that can be effectively studied by expeditionary scientific robots.
For instance, spatiotemporal distributions---deep sea hydrothermal plumes, algal blooms, weather cells---can be severely under-sampled or missed using nonadaptive strategies~\autocite{flaspohler2019information}.
Given the ubiquity of spatiotemporal phenomena and the cost of scientific field operations, it is critical to improve the efficacy of robots as autonomous scientific tools and extend their capabilities.

In this thesis, the challenges of performing informative sampling trajectories with expeditionary robots in spatiotemporal environments will be closely studied. 
This research spans theoretical to practical challenges and considerations, and was performed in close collaboration with scientists and engineers in fields including oceaonography and geochemistry, computational statistics, robotics, and data science.
Chief among the challenges addressed in this thesis is the problem of uncovering the underlying dynamics of a spatiotemporal distribution in a target environment.
With access to a perfect physics model of an environment, trajectories for a robotic platform could be exactly produced for some sampling task.
However, rarely (and arguably never) is such a perfect model of an environment available.
Instead, there is considerable \emph{uncertainty} about the underlying form of the dynamics model~\footnote{Both epistemic and aleatoric. Aleatoric uncertainty in this case comes from the chaotic nature of spatiotemporal distributions (for instance, turbulent flows). Epistemic uncertainty is definitional, as we have uncertainty of the model.}
To reduce uncertainty, roboticists and scientists alike typically turn to data; here in the form of \emph{in situ} observations.
Unfortunately, data that can be collected in real field trials with mobile platforms tends to be noisy and extremely partially observable---that is, the observations are only at point locations (in time and space) and may be indirect measurements of a desired field of interest. 
Practically, data-driven models trained with this type of data would require a huge number of samples in order to generalize a useful simulator for planning; a luxury that, in the field, is typically not afforded due to limited opportunities for deployments and finite mission timelines.

The problem of discovering a useful forward simulator for a target environment is not impossible, however.
Decades of research have been dedicated to the recovery of environmental models by experimental trials and mathematical reasoning via scientists' hands.
For instance, the Navier-Stokes equations which describe the motion of viscous fluids are the results of Leonhard Euler, Claude-Louis Navier, and George Gabriel Stokes stretching from 1757 to 1850. 
In this case, each mathematician started from the knowledge of their predecessor(s), and extended the sophistication of the model in turn.
This is a natural scientific process, and it is a process that is well suited for algorithmic adaptation.
The emergence of the field of scientific machine learning is some such evidence, as neural networks~\autocite{raissi2019physics, sapsis2009dynamically, mohan2019compressed}, Gaussian Processes (GPs)~\autocite{raissi2018numerical}, and similar representations~\autocite{kulkarni2019advection, brunton2016discovering} are developed which often leverage numerical scientific models or physical principles to approximately find novel forward simulators from relatively limited trajectory data in space-time.

To extend this algorithmic theory to field settings in which computational time is typically severely limited and field observations are corrupted via noise, the foundational\footnote{and implicitly more straightforward or simpler to compute} principles of an assumed underlying dynamical model may still be an informative basis on which to learn.
For instance, the concepts of non-divergence in flow fields and conservation of mass, and simplified models of time-averaged behaviors, can serve as an inductive bias\footnote{The term \emph{inductive bias} has a mixed connotation in learning. Designing an inductive bias will, definitionally, bias a learner towards the assumptions for unseen data. This is wonderful for an environmental context in which we're guaranteed to seeing things that were not in the original training data and for which grounded principles imply underlying structure, but in other contexts (particularly social and cultural), inductive bias in learned models may reflect and enforce systemically inappropriate or unconscious assumptions.} for probabilistic data-driven models.
Using \emph{physically-informed structure} reduces the burden on the data alone for recovery of a dynamics model and can be equivalently be considered a means for identifying a reduced basis for inference.
As some in robotics may say, however, there is no free lunch.
The use of physically-informed structure trades sample efficiency for increased computational costs (in comparison to purely data-driven techniques).
However, this trade-off can be tuned to the underlying models available, the sampling task at hand, and the operational logistics during field opportunities.

To embed scientific knowledge into probabilistic models for robot learning poses additional, necessary infrastructure.
The observations that a robot collects must correspond to the internal representation used by the robot (known as it's belief).
As scientific observations are typically taken by heterogeneous sensors with different operating principles and measuring different phenomenon which may have complicated relationships, the choice of observation model is not straightforward.
Indeed, modern scientific research rests on the interpretation \emph{in situ} observations.
While it is out of scope to assume that a roboticist become a domain expert in order to plan useful trajectories, familiarity with the forms, limitations, and working principles of critical science infrastructure may be necessary in order to make advances in modeling and planning.
This further implies that the development of expeditionary robotics cannot happen in a vacuum; collaboration with scientists who will ultimately use this technology must be undertaken.

In addition to context-specific observation models, the planning architecture that utilizes a physically-informed model must be considered.
Planning trajectories for expeditionary robots necessitates working under practical constraints.



% Thus the crux of the challenge: data driven probabilistic models require too much data to tractably learn simple dynamics that can be exploited for trajectory design, but numerical approximations of underlying dynamics may be too computationally expensive and brittle to real data to use instead.
