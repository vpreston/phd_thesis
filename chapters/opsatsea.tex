Preface that the intent of this chapter is to highlight practical engineering necessities and opportunities for deep sea research.

\section{Challenges in the Deep Ocean}
No GPS, no satellite, only acoustics, very few observatories, etc.

\section{Overview of Science Teams and Responsibilities}
Establish how computer scientists fit on a ship.

\section{Data Infrastructure on a Vessel}
Propose live-streaming\dots

\section{Taking Ground Truth Measurements}
Basically impossible, some things more than others.
